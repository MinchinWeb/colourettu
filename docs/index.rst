Colourettu version |version| documentation
==========================================

Colourettu is a small collection of colour functions in Python, that can be
used to determine the (relative) luminosity of a colour and the contrast
between two colours.

To install colourettu, the easiest way is to use `pip`::

    pip install colourettu

Note on Spelling
----------------

I have used the Canadian/British spelling of *colour* through this and
the code.
