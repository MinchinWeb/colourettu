.. currentmodule:: colourettu

- :bug:`-` Documentation: fix formula rendering for Sphinx 4.2

- :release:`2.1.0 <2021-10-05>`
- :feature:`148` various updates to ensure that the package is still installable
  (and hackable) on current versions of Python
- :support:`149` swap from Travis-CI to GitHub Actions for Continuous
  Integration
- :bug:`148 major` proofread documentation
- :support:`148` drop official support for Python < 3.6, including
  dropping support for Python 2. I haven't changed anything in the codebase
  that I expect will break these earlier versions, but I'm no longer testing
  against them.
- :support:`148` switch to personal fork of `PSphinxTheme
  <https://github.com/MinchinWeb/PSphinxTheme/tree/colourettu>`_ and `lconf lexer
  <https://github.com/MinchinWeb/python_lconf_lexer>`_ (i.e. basically the
  documentation theme) as to provide versions that can be installed with
  current versions of *pip*. Specifically, these private version provide
  PEP440-style version numbers.
- :support:`148` black-ify codebase
- :support:`148` update *isort* to v5
- :support:`147` update minimum versions of several dependencies to remove
  support for version with known security issues.
- :support:`7` upgrade to `minchin.releaser
  <https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.releaser>`_ package. Colourettu was
  previously using an early vendorized version of this.

- :release:`2.0.0 <2016-11-28>`
- :feature:`6` add *blend* functionality as both standalone functionality as
  :py:func:`blend()` and as a method of the Palette class as
  :py:func:`Palette.blend()`
- :bug:`- major` :py:func:`Palette.to_image()` now treats ``max_width`` as a
  maximum width. This way there isn't a black bar on the bottom/left of the
  image if the number of bands do not divide evenly into ``max_width``.
- :bug:`- major` [Breaking] Update :py:class:`Colour` and :py:class:`Palette`
  class naming to CapWords-style, to match PEP8.
- :support:`40` update cloud theme to v1.8, and with it Sphinx to v1.4. Also
  added to documentation layout improvements. (also :issue:`30`, :issue:`31`)
- :support:`-` ship tests such that the command ``green colourettu`` works
  from the command-line after ``colourettu`` has been installed on the system
- :support:`-` ship tests as a subpackage of ``colourettu``
- :support:`-` re-arrange and simplify internal package metadata and
  corresponding changes in ``setup.py``
- :support:`14` add code-style tests as another part of the Travis-CI
  test suite
